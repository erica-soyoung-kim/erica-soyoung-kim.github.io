        <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>IQ is a measure of cognitive abilities. It involves processing , knowledge, memory and reasoning. IQ affects academics, expertise, critical thinking and logic. Whereas, EQ is a measure of emotional competency. It involves identifying, controlling, and using emotions. EQ affects motivation, empathy, relationships, self-awareness, and self-control.</p>
        <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
        <p>Intelligence is not simply a single general ability. There are actually multiple intelligence. IQ may be one of the core element of success especially when it comes to academic achievement. However, IQ is not the only determinant of life success.
