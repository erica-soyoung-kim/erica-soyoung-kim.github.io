        <h2>Problem-Solving</h2>
        <p>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</p>
        
        <h3>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
        <p>During the kata task, I was stuck on accessing object element of different object. I ended up ask chat GPT how to access and it gave me a clear answer. I thought chatGPT was genius as it knew exactly what I was asking for. I learnt not to be afraid on searching online or use resources. </p>
        
        <h3>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
        <p>During the deBee tasks, I really could not figure out how to ignore the case sensitivity. Even searching on Google, it did not give me a clear answer. I checked on the discord, someone has asked about the same question and was answered. I had a look at the code, understood why and how they had this approach and solved it again. I was getting frustrated when I could not find the answer online, but I learnt ask group is very helpful also for those people who have the same problem as me.</p>
        
        <h3>3.  Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode</li>
            <li>Trying something</li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
            <li>Reading error messages</li>
            <li>Console.logging</li>
            <li>Googling</li>
            <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I have not been using Pseudocode well to be honest. I found it not easy to put it into word especially when I do not know where to start. <br>
            I still find it hard to ask discord and afraid I might be asking too simple questions, I know it is not the right attitude but looking at other people's posts has been very helpful.<br>
            I still do not feel confident using console.log()as I am not sure how to use it.<br>
            Other methods have been helpful and very useful for me.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h3>
        <p>I still am reluctant to ask on discord, mainly because I am a bit late with the tasks, but also I feel like it is a simple question to ask that I cannot solve or sometimes I do not know how to attempt the question and I did not want to ask someone to solve it for me.
          I will try to start the homework earlier next time.</p>
