// Step 1: You have a working day
let workingDay = true;

// Step 2: Check if you are working today
if (workingDay) {
    // Step 3: If you are working today, go to work
    console.log("Go to work")

} else {
    // Step 4: If you are not working today, stay home and do some housework
    console.log("stay home and do some housework");
}



For example, let's say you are going to work some days in a week. <br>
          When you wake up, if it is your working day, then you go to work. <br>
          Or else (if it is NOT your working day), then you do not go to work, stay at home and do some housework.
