        <h2>JavaScript - DOM</h2>
        
        <h3>1. An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
        <p>Imagine your webpage is a house, <span class="bold">HTML</span> is the structure of the house.<br>
          <span class="bold">CSS</span> is the interior design, such as colour, font, etc. <br>
          <span class="bold">JavaScript</span> is like the function of the house, such as electricity and plumbing. In webpage, it represents interactive form or animations.</p><br>
        
        <h3>2. Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Control flow</span> is like the steps you follow. <br>
          For example, let's say you are going to work some days in a week. <br>
          When you wake up, if it is your working day, then you go to work. <br>
          Or else (if it is NOT your working day), then you do not go to work, stay at home and do some housework. <br>
          <img src="../blog/homework img/ControlFlowJS.png" alt="JS example screenshot for Control flow"><br><br>

          <span class="bold">Loop</span> is like repeating tasks.<br> 
          For example, you exercise everyday for 30 minutes until you reach desired weight. <br>
          Everyday, you loop (exercise) until the condition is fulfilled (reach desired weight).<br>
          <img src="../blog/homework img/LoopJS.png" alt="JS example screenshot for loop"><br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h3>3. Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
        <p>
          DOM stands for Document Object Model. <br> 
          When you open a web page in your browser, the browser creates a tree-like structure for the page. Here is the example.<br><br>
          <img src="../blog/homework img/domTree.png"><br><br>
          You can interact with elements by using "document.getElementByID('ID name')" or "document.getElementByClass('Class name')"

        </p>
        
        <h3>4. Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Arrays</span> are ordered collections of value. Each value has a numeric index, starting from '0' and you can access elements in an array by using their numeric index using [  ]. Here is the example.<br><br>
          <img src="../blog/homework img/ArrayJS.png"><br><br>
          <span class="bold">Object</span> are collections of key-value. Each key is unique and you can access values in an object by using their key. It does not have any specific order. Here is the example.<br><br>
          <img src="../blog/homework img/ObjectJS.png"><br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h3>5. Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
        <p>A function is a storage for a block of reusable code that performs a specific task or calculates a value.<br>
          By using function, you do not need to write long same code over and over again.<br>
          If you set a function already, you can just call the function to do the work that you have already declared it to do. Here is the example.<br><br>
          <img src="../blog/homework img/functionJS.png"><br><br>
