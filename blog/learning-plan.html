        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
        <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>Be familiar with coding for web development and be able to fully shift the career into coding</p>
        <h3>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        <p>Strength: hanging on to a problem until fully understand and solve it<br>
          Limitation: time consuming</p>
        <h3>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>Time management and feeling comfortable to ask for help when needed.</p>
        <h3>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
          <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I believe communication is important especially when it comes to team work or group work. Communicate with each other with respect and gentleness.<br> 
          I always put some time aside for the study and homework every day and have a short term goal to finish how much by when.<br> 
          The time frame suggestion is very helpful too. <br>
          When things are starting to building up and getting to me, I will be opened about it, update the situation and ask for help.</p>
        <h3>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <p>I was always told do not hang onto a problem for more than 20 minutes. I am guilty about this. I will set a timer when I face a problem, ask google, partner, who has been in this field for years, and the discord foundation room if needed.</p>
        <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>I expect the facilitation team being an easy approach not only timely but also make me feel comfortable, which the team has been great.</p>
        <h3>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
        <p>I do have a little planner of my days. I have dropped my working hours to Tuesday and Friday and bit busy on weekends but Monday, Wednesday and Thursday is pretty much free. Although, we just find out I am pregnant and started being suffered from intense sickness so I will need to talk about it as what it means of me studying and planning for a future, like getting a job.</p>
