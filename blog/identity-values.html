        <h2>Identity-values</h2>
        <h3>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
        <p>Well, the latest ethical decision I had to made is thatâ€¦
          I am a registered nurse, currently working at GP practice. At the moment, there are many students coming for immunisation prior to entering university hall or boarding school.
          There are certain vaccination they are recommended to receive but I've found out that some of the information has not been delivered to the patient and their whanau due to the limited stock of vaccine available. 
          I have informed the pt that there are more vaccines available for them when they came for the second vaccine, so they can make informed choice. At the same time, there was a dilemma that not everyone may be able to receive this vaccine but I have decided to talk about it as every patient has right to know all the available option for them. 
          Then I brought up the issue to the nursing team so they can make solution to deal with the vaccine shortage and think about the fairness the patient have.
          </p>
        <h3>2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>My husband is a kind person. He really dislike being rude and he is often a mediate person in between his friends. He values the group and importance of friend. At church, when there is a group tasks happen, for example, doing dishes after lunch for the whole church.
          Ever since I have met him, this side of him has made me re-think about my behaviour and thoughts.
          I do like to blame work, and often describe myself that "I am so dead inside". This is coming from dealing with angry people and sick people for years and years. I also don't like people who are not passionate about their job or not good at job. I realised all these are excuses and I am being arrogant. 
          My mother-in-law is such a lovely person too. She would invite people over every week, cook for them and feed them, let them have a social gathering at her place. When I was going through hard time, she would come to our place to cook for us and take care of me. 
          Her and her family's loving nature has influenced how I would treat my friend and family and others.</p>
        <h3>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey</h3>
        <p>My strengths are being passionate and focused. When I am working, I would find extra jobs to do to help my colleagues. Being focused means that once I get used to what I am doing, my working speed increases dramatically. As I have decided to study and I am enjoying, these features will help me to go through to the end of the study.</p>
        <h3>4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
        <p>One of my limitation will be English. I need extra time to read and understand. 
          Another thing is that, despite I am very focused at the time, it does not last very long. I need to switch my tasks after some times. I get very bored if I am on the same tasks for a long time.</p>
        <h3>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p>At the end of last year, there was a planned group overseas trip. Lots of drama happened when planning the actual trip though. As it was a group of 8 people, everyone wanted different things. 
          So, I have made a spread sheet to gather all information and options together, and communicate through it. 
          We talked about what each people can give up and what they cannot give up, and planned around this, which has reduced many conflicts. 
          However, if I need to do this again, I will make the actual meeting and we can all gather together and talk about it more often instead of just communicating via online. This will reduce the risk of mis communication and misunderstanding.
