        <h3>1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <p>I have learnt that I like taking time and try to hold on to the problem if I do not understand. <br>
          But also I have learnt that things are too much for me, I tends to give up instead of moving on. <br>
          I also learnt that I need to and want to improve my EQ skills.</p>
        
        <h3>2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>The values, empathy, and self-awareness will provide motivation, and help thinking from the other's point of view, and indetify my own strength and weakness which can help managing stress and burn out. </p>

        <h3>3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>The condept of Neuroplasticity. It has been helping me a lot whenever I want to give up.</p>

        <h3>4. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>It was challenging thinking and identifying my own identity and values.</p>

        <h3>5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>I believe that the human skill is very important especially in team environment. And the culture they make carries on and it is hard to change. 
          By practicing these skills, I will be happier and more efficient at work but also make the team environment nicer.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>Although it was unusual study, I found it quite useful. It helped me understand myself better and quite interesting how I can view and analyse the situation. It definitely helped me when I was going through the hard time.</p>
