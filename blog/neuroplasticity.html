        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <h3>Discussed your understanding of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset and how it influences your learning</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. 
          A growth mindset creates an environment that nurtures and supports neuroplasticity. 
          The idea is that by believing in their ability to develop and improve, individuals are more inclined to engage in activities that challenge their existing skills and knowledge.
          I feel like Neuroplasticity and growth mindset is sort of what we have been exercising in the core exericises.
          The learning has became quite difficult and my condition was not suitable to study at the moment. I have been thinking maybe I am not suitable for this study and if I should drop it. 
          After learning about Neuroplasticity, I have been imagining positive attitude towards study when I am writing my diary, keep encouraging myself. 
          I believe that this actually has changed my attitude and and I feel more positive about these challenges now.
